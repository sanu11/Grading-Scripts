This is used to test questions: 3.1, 3.4, 3.5, 4.3, 6.7

There are  2 scripts:
	newScript.sh
	fileCheck.py
You are supposed to run newScript.sh
fileCheck.py is used for ex4_3 to check if output in the file is as expected.
You can comment the line that called fileCheck.py: Line 36 in newScript.sh ( since many times it gives error as students dont always print in the required format) and check files manually.

If the student has given all the names of files and functions as required, the script should run properly.
Else you may get error saying some class/function not found and will manually have to change it.
After changing it should work fine.

If something goes wrong for a particular question, just copy paste the commands for that questions and run on bash terminal.

All the inputs are given through the script for the test files in 4.3

Change the path variale presented on the first line of the script to point to testing directory of professor's folder on your laptop.
